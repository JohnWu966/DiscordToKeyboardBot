#Discord to Keyboard#

A Discord Bot that will convert messages sent to a Discord message into keyboard inputs.

The bot will parse every message it sees and press a button on the host's computer if it matches with a keyword.

As of current, the bot is configured to work with the standard controls for the Visual Boy Advance emulator for the Game Boy Advance, but extending the total list of controls should be intuitive enough.
